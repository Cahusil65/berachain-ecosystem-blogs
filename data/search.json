Raising over $18 million in its ICO, Ethereum has grown to become the definitive smart contract network, with the most active DeFi community and most on-chain activity relative to its peers. In recent years Ethereumâ€™s dominance has been challenged and questioned by the growing introduction of modular technology and the rapid adoption of alternative L1s.&nbsp;</p><p>The most popular consensus mechanism for modern blockchains is Proof-of-Stake, with Ethereum being a strong example of how PoS functions at a high level. While Bitcoin has been able to achieve great success with its Proof-of-Work model, the debate isnâ€™t relevant for todayâ€™s report - PoW is dependent on physical hardware, while PoS is more geared towards software.</p><p>Managing the balance of tradeoffs between <strong>security</strong>, <strong>speed</strong> and <strong>decentralization</strong>, PoS is able to align validators but falls short in rewarding its users, the backbone of any successful blockchain. Validators of Ethereum stake their ETH to participate in the act of approving transactions or creating new blocks, a feature thatâ€™s only accessible to those with 32 ETH. Ethereum has done well to grow the largest validator set in all of crypto, with almost 30 million staked at the time of writing, this sum possessing a market value of over $75 billion. Validators maintain the security of the network, putting their staked assets on the line to ensure transactions can be properly validated and included in future blocks.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of the inherent risk presented to validators, they earn a bulk of the rewards that come from being selected to validate blocks. Users, on the other hand, are entirely separate from this chain of command, unable to receive proper reward distribution from the protocol level. Even further, protocols and validators within PoS Ethereum are far from aligned, with protocols unable to improve security and validators separated from the benefits provided by protocols.&nbsp;</p><p>PoS is able to help blockchains achieve heightened security, but thereâ€™s a small issue not often discussed. In the case of Ethereum, the network exists with a single token model, as ETH is used for both staking and paying for transactions on-chain. If you think about it logically, using the same token for security and transactions does not make sense, given how crucial liquidity is to any financial environment. Thereâ€™s a reason you canâ€™t use fractionalized Starbucks shares to buy a cup of coffee - no one wants to trade in a share of ownership when fiat money is more accessible and offers zero downsides for the same transaction.&nbsp;</p><p>When users pay for a transaction in ETH, thatâ€™s a portion of the circulating supply that canâ€™t be used to further grow the security of Ethereum - this doesnâ€™t make sense, even if you approve of a deflationary supply over the long term to assist in making a token go up. In this scenario, users are forced to decide between spending their ETH in order to transact on-chain or staking their ETH to participate in validating the Ethereum network - thereâ€™s no option for those that might wish to do both with the same set of funds.</p><p>It would make the most sense to offer multiple tokens within a network, mainly to help eliminate any opportunity costs users feel are imposed upon them. While this makes sense in hindsight, this isnâ€™t something the Ethereum team would consider with much significance. Instead, we can build off these inefficiencies and design an economically viable way of managing incentives.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"introducing-pol-as-a-novel-economic-model\"><strong>Introducing PoL as a novel economic model&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Building off the shortcomings of PoS, Berachainâ€™s Proof-of-Liquidity presents itself as a novel consensus mechanism built to incentivize <em>all</em> parties, allowing for Berachainâ€™s security and liquidity to scale linearly. When it comes to growing the security of a decentralized network, there shouldnâ€™t need to be any trade-offs made that affect the user experience for marginal security improvements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Berachain has pioneered a new model, one that doesnâ€™t sacrifice on security and works to scale liquidity with the networkâ€™s stake - a delicate balance that pleases all actors within a blockchain ecosystem. Utilizing a tri-token model, Berachain is able to support the needs of LPs, standard users, validators and protocols. To better understand the balance of trade-offs achieved, we will briefly explain Berachainâ€™s tokens and their respective functions:</p><p>- <strong>BGT</strong>: The Berachain Governance Token is non-transferable and only earned through liquidity provision on Berachainâ€™s native decentralized exchange, BEX.</p><p>- <strong>BERA</strong>: Berachainâ€™s network token can only be used for the payment of transactions, allowing users to spend freely without reducing their capacity to help in network validation.&nbsp;</p><p>- <strong>HONEY</strong>: Berachainâ€™s native stablecoin will be pegged to USDC, purchasable through a variety of applications or the BEX.</p><p>In traditional crypto systems, LPs are incentivized to provide two-sided liquidity to earn a share of a given poolâ€™s volume, though this doesnâ€™t often work out well in practice due to issues like LVR (loss-versus-rebalancing) or the general volatility of nascent crypto markets on-chain, resulting in difficulty for consistent LP profitability. There have been some improvements and work done to help further improve profitability distributions among LPs, with Uniswap V3â€™s concentrated liquidity model leading to slight improvements for more sophisticated LPs.&nbsp;</p><p>In Berachainâ€™s PoL system, LPs would receive the benefit of BGT distributions, general LP rewards, any applicable rewards from blocks produced and any available validator bribes. By enabling further LP incentivization and providing a backstop in the form of BGT, Berachain is looking to solve problems at the application <em>and </em>protocol layer. If thereâ€™s enough of an incentive to delegate BGT and participate in a growing network, itâ€™s natural to assume that liquidity will follow.&nbsp;</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/f7VSt4csn934jNk_M7NrAxtoS6BClnuKgITwvoruK-gH0R1D6fR2w-5dUyKkySVJO2PWL8m85iru6ubXzEwFOt8DCE0O0oDeCxxsr-oGp1N91TG4lnvxKAlLseX6yz18JYSMuqaECsV-TynhmmDWtIY\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"711\"></figure><p></p><p>The introduction of an enshrined Berachain ecosystem makes this model more feasible, given the general alignment between protocols that would exist within this collective group. Traditionally, alternative L1s and Ethereum L2s have prioritized ecosystem funds to incentive builders to create applications. All too often, these follow the same trend of reskinned Uniswap and Aave forks. Further into an L1 or L2â€™s life cycle, more established protocols deploy, bringing a slight liquidity boost and offering more of a marketing kick than anything else. Enshrined ecosystems are a way of aligning a community from day one, rather than having to wait until nine months later after a failed ecosystem fund has made your chain indistinguishable from any of its competitors.&nbsp;</p><p>Users that delegate their BGT to validators earn a portion of distributed block rewards, along with any potential bribes proposed by validators. In an ideal world, validators and protocols would team up to increase the incentive kickback to users, enabling a further increase in LP participation amongst a larger number of users. While the PoL model is mostly novel in its approach to scaling liquidity and security without compromise, the separation between BERA and BGT is additionally useful in making the act of liquidity provision more appealing. While LPs in traditional DeFi protocols are doing it in a purely profit-driven manner, Berachain makes it beneficial as youâ€™re indirectly gaining governance power.&nbsp;</p><p>Within Ethereumâ€™s PoS model, there is no collaboration between protocols and the validator set, as there isnâ€™t a need to align towards a central goal when incentive distributions are skewed towards validators. Protocols arenâ€™t concerned with the security distribution or The utilization of bribes isnâ€™t a new concept, as we first saw this occur in the heat of the Curve Wars, with Convex and Hidden Hand being the two biggest proponents of this system. Berachain would be the first L1 to implement an enshrined bribe system to align all parties, taking a variety of lessons learned and folding it into a first-of-its-kind approach in GTM strategy.</p><h3 id=\"learning-from-the-past-to-build-a-better-future\"><strong>Learning from the past to build a better future</strong></h3><p>In the previous bull market we saw alternative L1s compete on the assumption they were <em>Ethereum Killers</em>, blockchains that were able to take advantage of Ethereumâ€™s network congestion issues and provide an alternative, bustling ecosystem of heavily funded applications with the kicker of cheap (and fast) transactions. Throughout 2020 and 2021 this worked very well, though the appeal of alternative L1s as simply marginally faster and cheaper Ethereum competitors has not retained the attention it once commanded. These days, itâ€™s much more difficult to simply <em>say</em> your blockchain is better because itâ€™s cheaper to transact on - you need to <em>show</em> your superiority. Technical differences like alternative VMs and various modular design choices carry far more weight, as almost any blockchain is able to raise money for an ecosystem fund and offer an alternative.&nbsp;</p><p>There are now a variety of different value propositions behind any L1 or L2, with each offering a unique ecosystem, set of tradeoffs and general strengths giving it more credibility over its peers. Solana has been able to dominate on both activity metrics and narrative since the latter half of 2023, becoming the de facto #2 behind Ethereum thanks to its vibrant community, local fee markets and strong validator set. Cosmos has seen a revival as well, spurred on by the success of Celestia, increasingly active IBC network and the developer communityâ€™s willingness to experiment on novel ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at L2s, Optimism has been able to develop an active community through its retroactive airdrop and a dedicated DeFi community, thanks to the utility of Velodrome and early support from Synthetix. Base is another example of community leading the way to increased attention, though Base has yet to catapult itself into the hierarchy dominated by Optimism and Arbitrum - liquidity is crucial, even if you inherit your security from Ethereum.&nbsp;</p><p>This concept builds off of the ideas proposed in USVâ€™s fat protocol thesis. The basic ideas of this fundamental thesis revolved around the failure of web2 protocols to capture the bulk of the value, letting applications take over and become the largest beneficiaries of the system. Crypto has narrowed the gap between protocol and application layer value consumption, but it still isnâ€™t perfect. If you look even further into the distribution of value present within applications and protocols, the user is often not rewarded proportionally to the immense value they create.&nbsp;</p><p>Bribes and closed-loop incentive systems in DeFi were beneficial to those that participated in the ecosystem - it was never going to serve as an extendable process beyond niche subsectors of DeFi. Curve governance and the demand for veCRV was never a pertinent issue to the value capture of Ethereum as a base layer, let alone the success of Cosmos or Solana and their respective ecosystems. In the increasingly modular world of blockchains, the concept of open-loop incentive mechanisms is more valuable than ever before. The traditional financial system is immensely difficult to govern over, largely because of how interconnected it is and how every cog plays an important role in the great machine. PoL serves as a potential step improvement towards the first open-loop, extendable incentive system at the protocol level.&nbsp;</p><p>Itâ€™s difficult to compare Berachain the L1 to Curve the application, but the concept of closed versus open loops make sense with a little context. Concerning Curve (and veCRV specifically), the ability to gain meaningful or significant governance power was useful if you had skin in the game that pertained to Curve, but it wasnâ€™t relevant if your application wasnâ€™t dependent on the success or failure of Curve.&nbsp;</p><p>While Curve was heavily integrated across the DeFi ecosystem and was an extremely core piece of the system as we know it, extending veCRV incentives across the entire crypto ecosystem was never a feasible reality. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with a closed-loop incentive system, but it is our belief that crypto can benefit largely from prioritizing collaborative open-loop systems that leave the door open to innovation.</p><p>As highlighted earlier, modular blockchains are increasingly a core topic of contention and leading the way for blockchain design at all levels of the tech stack. Interoperable VM environments, evolving consensus mechanisms and shared modular building blocks (see: data availability or shared sequencing) are enabling a world where inter-blockchain communication will quickly become the norm. Now is the time to develop open-loop incentive systems and take advantage of this new paradigm of communication.&nbsp;</p><p>While it isnâ€™t entirely clear where value should accrue in this hypothetical (but increasingly likely) multichain world, itâ€™s undeniable that L1s and L2s will need to collaborate more than ever before to accommodate for the increasingly debated issue of fragmented liquidity. Even though a modular blockchain might be technically superior to its monolithic counterparts, there isnâ€™t a standardized way of solving the fragmentation problem and L2s are quickly becoming more competitive towards each other, the exact opposite system of what modularity was supposed to carry the industry towards.</p><p>When protocol ownership is distributed to users from the beginning, alignment isnâ€™t something that needs to be worked on extensively or slotted in a roadmap for future integration - itâ€™s a core feature, one thatâ€™s just as immutable as the blockchain itâ€™s built into.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"some-examples-of-incentive-mechanisms-across-pos-blockchains-and-how-pol-can-fill-in-the-gaps\"><strong>Some examples of incentive mechanisms across PoS blockchains and how PoL can fill in the gaps</strong></h2><p>The blockchain trilemma has said that tradeoffs must be made between security, decentralization and speed. This was the consensus prior to the growth of modular blockchain configurations, which have made it possible for blockchains to accommodate for all three without needing to overengineer complex design choices or limit the behaviors of its core user base. Now that developers are able to integrate functionality like shared sequencing layers, data availability laters or even the offloading of proving to dedicated zk proving markets, the game has changed dramatically.&nbsp;</p><p>We mentioned how itâ€™s difficult for L1s and L2s to differentiate on community and product offerings alone, and while this is still the case for some aspects of blockchain architecture, itâ€™s my belief that innovation on this front will open the door for further experimentation around economic incentives.&nbsp;</p><p>Using PoS as the main comparator to PoL and its improvements, we can look at how the dynamics of token ownership across other PoS chains has evolved recently. Most importantly, we can explore some of the equilibriums occurring across different blockchains and whether or not users are being properly rewarded for their capital contributions. Letâ€™s take a look at Celestia and its native token, TIA.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"exploring-the-relationship-between-tia-stakers-and-celestia-validators\"><strong>Exploring the relationship between TIA stakers and Celestia validators</strong></h3><p>While Celestia is mostly regarded for its utility as a data availability layer for modular blockchains, Celestia is a PoS chain at its core. Celestiaâ€™s validators are tasked with verifying the transactions sent in by light nodes, with the TIA token capable of being delegated (via staking) to these validators in order to further increase network security. The original model was fairly standard for blockchains utilizing the Tendermint SDK, where stakers of a native token are rewarded with future emissions and an attractive enough APY to ensure alignment between both parties.&nbsp;</p><p>When TIA first launched, many were still fairly out of the loop on what a modular blockchain is, let alone how important something like a data availability is to the functioning of many distinct modular blockchains. Within a very short time period, the narrative changed drastically. TIA saw its price increase from roughly $2.5 to over $20 a token, occurring in less than three months. The broader crypto community saw another narrative forming, one that was entirely separate from the core value proposition intended for TIA stakers - something Iâ€™d like to define as recursive airdrop farming. The community saw a large number of projects building within the Celestia ecosystem, many of which without a token. The idea to stake TIA and receive a share of future airdrops quickly caught on, resulting in what can only be theorized as a medium term reduction in TIAâ€™s float due to overwhelming staking demand.&nbsp;</p><p>The announcement of Dymensionâ€™s airdrop which rewarded TIA stakers with DYM only further propelled this narrative, resulting in a new concept of incentive alignment that was almost entirely community driven. While weâ€™ve only focused on the side of consumer theory driving supply dynamics, I believe that this is a very engaging idea thatâ€™s only possible with blockchain technology. In traditional finance, you wouldnâ€™t be able to own shares in company A to receive dividends from company B - the traditional financial system and global economy doesnâ€™t operate with the ideals of shared success that crypto does; it goes against the driving tenets of capitalism and competitive nature.&nbsp;</p><p>Comparing the economic incentive alignment of Celestia and Ethereum, it can be argued that Celestia has done a better job of bootstrapping not only a secure network, but a seemingly motivated community willing to participate in this environment as long as theyâ€™re thoroughly compensated. Putting aside all debate of Celestiaâ€™s technicals as a data availability later, I believe that the success of TIA staking is a valid precursor to what PoL is looking to achieve. Weâ€™ve already covered the downsides that occur from offering a single network token in the example of Ethereum, but letâ€™s explore some of the potential synergies between a PoL model through the lens of Celestiaâ€™s incentivization.&nbsp;</p><p>TIA stakers provide the backbone of PoS Celestia, trading their immediate liquidity to receive a yield on their staked assets and the additive stream of potential airdrops. They delegate these tokens to validators of their choosing, similar to the model present within Berachain. Despite the premise being quite similar, there are a couple problems regarding the longevity of this system: TIA is the singular network token for Celestia, where applications must pay for data availability services in TIA and users must spend their TIA to pay for transactions. While Celestia has been able to jumpstart network security and provide economic incentives, this doesnâ€™t appear to be a sound, long term model. Network users are still required to spend their TIA and a stream of airdrops cannot persist indefinitely.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"pol-as-the-potential-first-properly-aligned-consensus-mechanism-with-longevity-in-mind\"><strong>PoL as the potential first properly aligned consensus mechanism with longevity in mind</strong></h3><p>PoL navigates these difficulties, utilizing BGT as its main reward function, separating the emissions and creating a sustainable revenue stream through traditional dynamics of block validation, with bribes used to enable a secondary market atop core PoS functionality. Beyond all of this, one of the most important questions to answer is whether or not Berachain validators and BGT stakers can maintain a properly aligned relationship far into the future - a blockchainâ€™s block space is only as valuable as its demand for it at any given time.&nbsp;</p><p>While this report wonâ€™t get into the dynamics of Berachainâ€™s ecosystem, cross-protocol interactions and other topics related to adoption and usage, we can make an argument that Berachain blockspace <em>will </em>be highly in-demand, especially given the recurring issue of Ethereum transaction costs and a lack of originality present across existing blockchains. If youâ€™d like to explore the Berachain ecosystem in greater detail, hereâ€™s a link to an excellent report covering the current state of BeraFi.&nbsp;</p><p>As I was saying before, Celestia faces multiple challenges in ensuring a proper alignment between TIA stakers and the networkâ€™s validator set, along with the issue of eventual adoption. Itâ€™s well known that Celestia enables modular blockchains to integrate it as a data availability layer, but Celestia also extends the option for sovereign blockchains to be built atop Celestiaâ€™s tech stack. In a bull market, you can make the assumption that users will come and revenues will increase - but what happens after that? Itâ€™s been much easier to create sustainable models of blockchain growth given the benefit they have in not relying on a singular use case.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a handful of applications that have persisted throughout all of DeFiâ€™s life cycle, but this pales in comparison to the number that have faded away after liquidity mining incentives or have simply seen usage drop off a cliff due to lack of product-market fit. Blockchains offer everything from a secure validator set, ecosystem of applications and obvious utility thatâ€™s inherent in blockchain design - this is where Berachain can succeed.&nbsp;</p><p>Itâ€™s been difficult for crypto to fulfill the fat protocol thesis, but what if the answer was in front of us the whole time? From my perspective, enshrined ecosystems work in favor of a blockchain, developing an aligned set of applications and loyal users that feel comfortable participating in actions like LPing and delegating, knowing the rewards available. The larger number of users you draw into your ecosystem, the more likely it is theyâ€™re converted as well. The phenomenon can be examined through the most widespread example of an enshrined ecosystem, this being Apple and MacOS. Those that purchase an iPhone or MacBook are almost immediately sucked into the Apple ecosystem, becoming so dependent on it for everything from cloud storage to iMessage functionality that there isnâ€™t much incentive to leave. Appleâ€™s hardware and software design are not technically superior to its competitors, which doesnâ€™t align with the traditional belief that faster and cheaper blockchains will win out, but it does confirm that thereâ€™s real value in offering a superior user experience. Users of Apple products enjoy the UI, ease of access and a variety of other ancillary features available to them.&nbsp;</p><p>Going back to the broader topic of finance, if you are a financial system of any kind, liquidity is more than likely the #1 factor that goes into crafting that user experience. If you are a DEX, you need liquidity for new coins. If you are a lending protocol, you need borrowers to provide the yield for lenders. In the traditional financial system, liquidity is the key to ensuring the stock market continues turning and keeps the global economy running smoothly. Berachainâ€™s enshrined ecosystem is a feature that directly serves PoL, creating an entirely unique flywheel never attempted at the protocol layer.</p><h2 id=\"exploring-the-near-future-of-pol-and-its-effects-on-liquidity\"><strong>Exploring the near future of PoL and its effects on liquidity</strong></h2><p>With all of this in mind, you might be asking yourself how PoL will function in reality, and whether or not a system can be self-sufficient in an industry as volatile as crypto. Ignoring the question of incentives at the protocol layer, weâ€™re stuck wondering how Berachain might behave once mainnet is live, when the users start flooding in and breathing life into the network. Where will they choose to provide liquidity? What type of coins will be launched, and which of these will attract the most liquidity? Will meta flywheels emerge amongst Berachain protocols, with alliances forming to further incentivize LPs in the pursuit of more BGT?</p><p>While most of these questions canâ€™t be answered without a live environment of Berachain mainnet upon, theyâ€™re very important to consider. As highlighted earlier, L2s have been very interesting to examine due to the heterogeneity of communities, despite sharing very similar architectures and value propositions. As far as L1s go, most of the activity since FTXâ€™s fallout has been centered in Ethereum and more recently Solana, with very little innovation at the protocol or application layer.&nbsp;</p><p>User activity in crypto to-date has been nearly entirely driven by financial pursuits, exemplified by a lack of unique product offerings in the application space despite the numerous advancements in blockchain architecture. Weâ€™re becoming increasingly modular, performant and superior alternatives to traditional financial systems, but what will it take to make that great leap? PoL on its own is an impressive step forward in blockchain design, but it wouldnâ€™t be significant without the additional steps taken by the Berachain team to build a complementary structure surrounding it.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a variety of promising, unique protocols building atop the primitives offered by Berachain. To give a short list, thereâ€™s Gummi, Infrared, Kodiak, Shogun, IVX and many, many more- how might these teams use PoL to their advantage? Are there hidden synchronicities waiting to be unlocked, partnerships or strategic collaborations that can unlock value and create a truly aligned ecosystem? Numerous attempts have been made in recent months to build L1s or L2s with a community-first mindset, though none have succeeded for an extended period of time. Itâ€™s disingenuous to market a blockchain as a place of battleground, an arena where your users are forced to compete amongst each other to extract value from a whitelisted group of protocols.&nbsp;</p><p>In a world where Berachain launches and PoL becomes a dominant alternative to PoS, thereâ€™s immense value in this unified ecosystem where value creation can exist within its own sovereignty. Thereâ€™s frequent debate over cross-chain interactions, infrastructure and solutions designed to bridge applications to new ecosystems. Despite this, we as an industry are far from a scenario where users can access cross-chain liquidity, with easy access between chains for traditional on-chain activities like making swaps, purchasing an NFT or depositing into a new protocol. What if everything you needed to do was situated on one blockchain, situated within an ecosystem where protocols complement each other and share the pie?</p><p>Ethereum and Solana are dominant because of the respective value they offer to users. Solana has gained traction as a hub where users can cheaply transact and trade memecoins, and though their technical merits are what make this world a reality, the majority of their users are most likely blind or indifferent to what makes the chain run so smoothly. Ethereum has enjoyed the #1 spot for sometime now due to its first-mover advantage and the variety of applications available for users, though its network congestion of 2021 - which led to an alt L1 renaissance - contributed to the environment we find ourselves in today. Solana is beating out Ethereum, not only on transaction costs, but on culture.&nbsp;</p><p>There isnâ€™t anything wrong with different blockchains serving different needs, but thereâ€™s a lot of value in creating cultures that go against the norms. Most of the worldâ€™s largest corporations today are tech companies - Microsoft, Apple, Meta and Google. These didnâ€™t begin as trillion dollar corporations that dominate the global economy, they started as novel experiments in a new industry, one that wasnâ€™t widely respected and frequently laughed at by outsiders. They made a name for themselves by offering a valuable product or service, but also by standing out and leaning into it. While their cultures are quite different today, names like Google and Facebook used to be the hottest place to be for new graduates. Their offices were different, more inviting and laid back. The culture revolved around open collaboration and a desire to pursue new ideas. They were a breath of fresh air.&nbsp;</p><p>Itâ€™s becoming increasingly obvious that the world weâ€™re living in will need more than one blockchain. There wonâ€™t be a single winner - if there is, weâ€™ve failed. Users want to transact the way they want to, however they want to, on any blockchain they want to. If they want to trade memecoins on Solana, they can do that and also deposit ETH into a lending protocol on Base for 12% APY. </p>","comment_id":"66031c1355162600017f87e6","feature_image":"https://berachain.ghost.io/content/images/2024/03/image--2--1.png","featured":true,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2024-03-26T19:03:47.000+00:00","updated_at":"2024-04-10T17:51:22.000+00:00","published_at":"2024-03-26T19:04:56.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"tags":[{"id":"6601731184ad420008257593","name":"News","slug":"news","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://berachain.ghost.io/tag/news/"}],"authors":[{"id":"6601aa8d315f350001c3c902","name":"Mei Mei","slug":"mei","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://berachain.ghost.io/author/mei/"},{"id":"66042f2f8bae2c00015e7e4f","name":"Coin","slug":"coin","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://berachain.ghost.io/author/coin/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"6601aa8d315f350001c3c902","name":"Mei Mei","slug":"mei","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://berachain.ghost.io/author/mei/"},"primary_tag":{"id":"6601731184ad420008257593","name":"News","slug":"news","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://berachain.ghost.io/tag/news/"},"url":"https://berachain.ghost.io/flow-of-value-examining-the-differences-between-pos-and-pol-a-case-for-a-new-paradigm-in-sustainable-incentive-alignment-at-the-protocol-layer/","excerpt":"ðŸ’¡How does PoS excel and where does it come short?\n\nEthereum began as an experiment in whether or not a permissionless and decentralized financial system could be built from the ground up, with little to no intermediation from centralizing third parties.
